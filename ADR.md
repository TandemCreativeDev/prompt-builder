# Architecture Design Decision: System Architecture for AI-Assisted Prompt Repository & Generator

## Status

Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

The project requires designing the system architecture for an AI-assisted prompt repository and generator. The application is a monolithic, serverless Next.js web application utilising TypeScript. The initial version will support a single user, with plans to accommodate multiple users in the future. Data persistence is achieved through JSON files, with potential migration to MongoDB later. The architecture should prioritise simplicity, scalability, and adherence to Unix principles, facilitating future enhancements.

## Decision Drivers

- **Simplicity:** Adherence to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to ensure ease of development and maintenance.
- **Scalability:** Design considerations to support future multi-user capabilities and potential data migration.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency and integrity, especially during transitions between storage solutions.
- **Operability:** Alignment with Unix principles, emphasising modularity and composability.

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic Serverless Architecture with JSON File Storage**

   - **Description:** Utilise a single Next.js application with serverless API routes, storing data in JSON files.
   - **Pros:**
     - Simplicity in deployment and management.
     - Low operational overhead during initial development.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited scalability for multi-user support.
     - Potential challenges with data consistency during migration to MongoDB.

2. **Monolithic Serverless Architecture with MongoDB Integration**

   - **Description:** Integrate MongoDB from the outset for data storage within the Next.js application.
   - **Pros:**
     - Scalability to support multiple users.
     - Consistent data structure facilitating future enhancements.
   - **Cons:**
     - Increased complexity in initial setup and deployment.
     - Higher operational overhead during early development stages.

3. **Modular Monolithic Architecture with Microservices for Data Handling**
   - **Description:** Develop a modular monolithic application with separate microservices for data storage and management.
   - **Pros:**
     - Enhanced scalability and flexibility.
     - Clear separation of concerns, aligning with Unix principles.
   - **Cons:**
     - Increased architectural complexity.
     - Potential challenges in managing inter-service communication.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Monolithic Serverless Architecture with JSON File Storage

**Rationale:**

- **Simplicity:** Aligns with the project's initial scope, focusing on rapid development and deployment.
- **Scalability Considerations:** While the initial version targets a single user, the architecture allows for future integration of MongoDB to support multiple users.
- **Consistency Management:** JSON file structure facilitates straightforward data handling, with clear paths for migration to MongoDB, ensuring data consistency during transitions.
- **Operability:** The monolithic design simplifies deployment and monitoring, adhering to Unix principles by maintaining a single, cohesive codebase.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Accelerated development and deployment timelines.
  - Simplified operational management during the initial phase.
- **Negative:**
  - Potential limitations in handling multiple users concurrently.
  - Operational challenges during the transition to MongoDB, requiring careful data migration strategies.

This decision establishes a clear architectural foundation, balancing immediate project needs with future scalability and consistency requirements.
